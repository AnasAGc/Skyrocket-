        <h2>Simple Steps to Skyrocket Your Time Management Skills</h2>
        <p>You have probably wished there were more than 24 hours a day to get more work done and spend more time on other meaningful things in your life. Unfortunately, you can not add more hours to a day, but the good news is that you can always learn to use them more wisely.</p>

        <h3>Plan the work</h3>

        <p>Productivity is not about doing more things – it is about doing the right things. It is all about planning: mapping the tasks required to achieve the desired goal, and prioritizing: ensuring you are doing the right things.

            Start by setting up a defined master plan for your project. Then, break the plan down into tasks and subtasks. Set deadlines for the entire project, including each task and subtask – and stick to them.
            
            Productivity expert Brian Tracy says that every minute you spend in planning saves 10 minutes in execution. It takes only about 10 to 12 minutes for you to plan out your day, but this small investment of time will save you up to two hours (100 to 120 minutes) in wasted time and diffused effort through the day.</p>


        <h3>Work the plan</h3>
        <P>The next step is to perform the defined tasks and sub-tasks in the prioritized order and ahead of set deadlines.

            David Allen, the creator of the Getting Things Done (GTD) productivity method, recommends having a to-do list for each day: write tasks down in an organized, clear, and simple way. But remember to be realistic about what you can accomplish in a day and do not set yourself up for failure with an unrealistically long agenda. It is recommended that you keep a list of three to eight tasks that you absolutely need to do each day.</P>

        <h3>Make every second count with time management software</h3>
        <p>To stick to the project master plan and not miss deadlines, try tracking your time on work, meetings, etc., with time management software. It is eye-opening to dig into work reports that reflect on your productivity and pinpoint ‘time-wasters’ – it improves your work results, optimizes your workload, and improves your planning skills.

            Did you know that a whopping 87% of high-performing companies use time management or project management software? And for modern organizations, the success of a project initiative will be tied to the tools they use. Spreadsheets are still ruling in the world of general project management, but for time management, centralization, collaboration, and sharing information – spreadsheets are still quite limited.</p>
